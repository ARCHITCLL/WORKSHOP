            I think the DL or Descriptive List is used to create descriptions or definitions or writing definitions in a descriptive manner which can be used in many research and scientific fields with a structured paragraph.

        <dd>

            </li>
        </ol>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            This is a fine way to work with definition list I have to say that working in this way is quite irritating but its fun when we see the output on the screen.
